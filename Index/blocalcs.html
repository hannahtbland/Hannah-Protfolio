        <p>For this project we take you through our design story of how we got to our final design of BLOCAL. BLOCAL started out as a combination of ideas when our team was prompted to design a new app that we thought was important to us. After many discussions and sticky notes later we found that supporting our community was something we wanted help and focus on. With this we all found it was hard sometimes finding local restaurants especially if you were hungry. That we wanted to design something different to help users.</p>

        <p class="finds">After conducting our interviews and getting the results from posting our survey we were able to understand what users needed and what their path was to find locally owned restaurants.</p>

                  <p class="card-text text">After we placed all our notes on sticky notes we started to group them together based on similarity and what users had in common.

        <p>After compiling all our rnotes and building our affinity diagram we were able to understand was user we were designing BLOCAL for Abby our user persona.</p>

        <h2><img src="../Index/Images/hibiscusflower.png">Definition</h2>
        </div>
        <p>With Abby we were able to start the process of understanding our problem that we wanted to solve. We started with doing a competitor analysis to see what competitors that were similar to our idea had success in and where it falls short. We also included ones that were indirect to our idea and did the same thing.<br>From the competitor analysis we took the user insights that stood out to us the most and focused on those to help build on to get us to our problem statement.</p>
        <h3>User Insights</h3>
        <div class="cent">
        <ul>
        <li>Visuals important</li>
        <li>Impatient, too many options</li>
        <li>Want information</li>
        <li>Important to support locally owned restaurants</li>
        <li>Comfort zone</li>
        <li>Sometimes disappointed</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

    <p>After the research and understanding the users and many attempts to achieve a problem statement we believed best described what we wanted to solve we got our PROBLEM STATEMENT:</p>
    <p class="ps">BLOCAL is designed to make restaurant goers feel confident and excited in their locally owned restaurant choices. We observed when users are hungry they make impromptu decisions because information on current apps is cluttered and overwhelming. How might we streamline search information into a simple and visually appealing layout so restaurant goers successfully choose a restaurant and return to the app to leave a review? </p>

        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <div class="brp">
       <p>Once we had our problem statement we finally could start our ideation & our design process. We first began by brainstorming ideas of what we wanted BLOCAL to have by using the I like, I wish, What if method. Once we had all our ideas on sticky notes we conducted a dot voting method not just with us but with potential users.</p>

       <div class="prp">
        <p>The ideas that had dots on them we moved them to the side and started to prioritize them as a group and discuss which ones were idealistic and what would actually be beneficial to our users with still be different. That we came up with a feature that we hadn't seen before and was something that would be impactful to the client</p>

        <p>Once we had our feature that we wanted to focus on we started ideating user scenarios and storyboarding when a user would want to use this feature. Which helped us build out our user flow for Abby and other users. We did build out multiple user flows specific to the on the fly feature for users who had an account with BLOCAL or didn't as we wanted users to still be able to use the app without having an account.</p>

Then showing & explaining what that new feature does as it is something new that users haven't experienced before.</p><p>However, for the future & possible enhancements that I would like to see and as a team we would like to expand outside of just restaurants. Gather more real-world feedback on the user's experience with the app. Add map/directions feature. Add map search feature. Add a Plan Your Night feature - user provides location and radius and randomizer provides food, activities, etc.</p>
